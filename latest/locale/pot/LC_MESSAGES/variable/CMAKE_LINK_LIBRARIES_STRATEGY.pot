"CMake generates a target's link line using its :ref:`Target Link "
"Properties`. In particular, the :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` target property "
"records the target's direct link dependencies, typically populated by calls "
"to :command:`target_link_libraries`.  Indirect link dependencies are "
"propagated from those entries of :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` that name "
"library targets by following the transitive closure of their :prop_tgt:"
"`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` properties.  CMake supports multiple strategies "
"for passing direct and indirect link dependencies to the linker."

"Entries of :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` always appear first and in their "

"entries may be reordered and de-duplicated with respect to one another, but "
"are always appended after the original entries. This may result in less "

"independent entries.  Such control may be important when intermixing link "
