"This command generates CMake variables and targets from pkg-config format "
"package files natively, without needing to invoke or even require the "
"presence of a pkg-config implementation. A ``<package>`` is either an "
"absolute path to a package file, or a package name to be searched for using "
"the typical pkg-config search patterns. The optional ``<version>`` string "
"has the same format and semantics as a pkg-config style version specifier, "
"with the exception that if no comparison operator is specified ``=`` is "
"assumed."
