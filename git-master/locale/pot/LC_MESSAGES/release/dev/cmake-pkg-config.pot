"The :command:`cmake_pkg_config` command was added as an endpoint for using "
"CMake's native pkg-config format parser. The only supported option in this "
"release is ``EXTRACT``, which provides low-level access to the values "
"produced by parsing a pkg-config file. For most users, this is not yet a "
"suitable replacement for the :module:`FindPkgConfig` module."
